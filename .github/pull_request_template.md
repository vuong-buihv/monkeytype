Adding a language or a theme? Make sure to edit the `_list.json` file and add the `language.json` or `theme.css` as well, otherwise, it will not work!

Please reference any issues related to your pull request.

If your change is visual (mainly themes) it would be extra awesome if you could include a screenshot.
